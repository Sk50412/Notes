==methods in Conceptually similar to functions and procedures in other high level languages In general, they are chunks of code that can be called on a particular object.== Method can accept parameters as arguments and their behaviour depends on the object they belong to and the values of any parameters that are passed. A method definition has two parts, the signature, which defines the name and parameters per method and the body which defines what method does
